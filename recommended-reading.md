## Recommended Reading

This is a summary of articles, presentations, papers and books that I strongly recommend all Software Engineers to have read.

I will try to summarize each, but I'll likely do a terrible job of it. Instead, just click through and watch/read for yourself.

### Presentations

### Books

While there are many books I would recommend, I need to think harder about the ones I consider to be truly important.
