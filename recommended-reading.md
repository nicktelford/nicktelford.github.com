## Recommended Reading

This is a summary of articles, presentations, papers and books that I strongly recommend all Software Engineers to have read.

I will try to summarize each, but I'll likely do a terrible job of it. Instead, just click through and watch/read for yourself.

### Presentations

<dl class="short">
    <dt>
        [Simple Made Easy](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy) (Rich Hickey)
    </dt>
    <dd>
        A look at how embracing simplicity, and sometimes shunning easiness, can conquer complexity.
    </dd>
</dl>

### Articles

<dl class="short">
    <dt>[Notes on Distributed Systems](http://www.somethingsimilar.com/2013/01/14/notes-on-distributed-systems-for-young-bloods/) (Jeff Hodges)</dt>
    <dd>Advice from the front-lines on designing, building and running distributed systems. Recommended for everyone, but required reading for anyone working with distributed systems.</dd>
    <dt>[http://codahale.com/you-cant-sacrifice-partition-tolerance/](You Can't Sacrifice Partition Tolerance) (Coda Hale)</dt>
    <dd>A debunking of the interpretation of the [CAP Theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem) that "CA" distributed systems (that is, a system that sacrifices partition tolerance) are possible.</dd>
    <dt>[How To Safely Store a Password](http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/) (Coda Hale)</dt>
    <dd>A succinct and excellent discussion on securely storing passwords and the dangers of not doing so.</dd>
</dl>

### Papers

<dl class="short">
    <dt>[MapReduce](http://research.google.com/archive/mapreduce.html) (Google)</dt>
    <dd>The seminal paper on the MapReduce programming model for distributed computation.</dd>
    <dt>[BigTable](http://research.google.com/archive/bigtable.html) (Google)</dt>
    <dd>Google's scalable column-family oriented database. Inspired much of the design of [HBase](http://hbase.apache.org/) and [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/).</dd>
    <dt>[Amazon's Dynamo](http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2007/10/amazons_dynamo.html) (Amazon)</dt>
    <dd>A key-value store that describes *eventual consistency*, a consistency model utilized heavily by [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/) and [Riak](http://basho.com/products/riak-overview/), among many others.</dd>
</dl>

### Books

While there are many books I would recommend, I need to think harder about the ones I consider to be truly important.
