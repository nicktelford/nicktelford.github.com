title: The Evolution of Database Design
---

TODO: a post on how the evolution of the performance characteristics of different components (e.g. CPUs, RAM, 
disk throughput, disk seek latency etc.) has affected database design. B-tree's are an algorithmically efficient
structure for on-disk storage, but as the discrepancy between disk seek latency and everything else has increased, 
it's relative efficiency has dropped.

TODO: Use accurate data and graphs on the history of each component.
