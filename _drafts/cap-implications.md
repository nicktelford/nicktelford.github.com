title: Implications of the CAP Theorem 
---

TODO: A post about the implications of the CAP theorem. Specifically, that partition tolerance is what defines a system as distributed; therefore, while "CA" systems exist, they are (by definition) not distributed. Examples are just about every mainstream relational database. Including systems that replicate (both master-slave and master-master).
